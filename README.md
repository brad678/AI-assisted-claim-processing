# Claims Processing Pipeline with GCP

This repository contains code for processing claims data using Google Cloud Functions and Apache Beam (Dataflow). The goal is to trigger a Dataflow job whenever a new claims file is uploaded to a specified Cloud Storage bucket. The Dataflow job performs data processing, feature extraction, and predictions using a pre-trained model.

## Setup and Deployment

1. **Model Training**
2. **Deploy the Cloud Function**
3. **Run the Dataflow Pipeline**
4. **Upload Data to trigger the pipeline**
